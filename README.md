# AVR Assembler

This project attempts to implement a simple assembler for the AVR Assembly Language specified [here](https://www.microchip.com/webdoc/avrassembler/index.html). The general structure and design will be adapted from [this](http://www.ssmengg.edu.in/weos/weos/upload/EStudyMaterial/Cse/4thSem/new/System%20Software/SS_Assembler%20design.pdf) paper.

The purpose of this project is to learn how an assembler works, as well as to learn the basics of the Rust programming language.
